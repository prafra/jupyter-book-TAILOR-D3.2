# The TAILOR project

## In brief
<a href="https://tailor-network.eu" terget=_blank>TAILOR</a> is an EU project with the aim build the capacity to provide the scientific foundations for Trustworthy AI in Europe. TAILOR develops a network of research excellence centers, leveraging and combining learning, optimization, and reasoning (LOR) with the key concepts of Trustworthy AI (TAI).

## More in detail

The purpose of the EU Project TAILOR is to build the capacity to provide the scientific foundations for Trustworthy AI in Europe by developing a network of research excellence centers leveraging and combining learning, optimization, and reasoning. These systems are meant to provide descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive systems integrating data-driven and knowledge-based approaches.
Artificial Intelligence (AI) has grown unprecedentedly in the last ten years. It has been applied to many industrial and service sectors, becoming ubiquitous in our everyday life. More and more often, AI systems are used to suggest decisions to human experts, to propose actions, and to provide predictions. Because these systems might influence our lives and significantly impact how we decide, they need to be trustworthy. How can a radiologist trust an AI system analyzing medical images? How can a financial broker trust an AI system providing stock price predictions? How can a passenger trust a self-driving car?

These are fundamental questions that require deep analysis and fundamental research activity, as well as a new generation of AI talents who are skilled in the scientific foundations of Trustworthy AI, who know how to assess, and how to design, trustworthy AI systems. Some of the current issues related to lack of trust in AI systems are a direct consequence of the massive use of black-box methods relying only on data. One needs to define the foundations of a new generation of AI systems not only relying on data-driven approaches but also on the whole set of AI techniques, including symbolic AI methods, optimization, reasoning, and planning.

The main objectives of the TAILOR project
```

The project is articulated into five research areas:
- [Trustworthy AI](./TAILOR) to develop the foundation of Trustworthy AI.
- Paradigms and representations to combine and integrate learning, reasoning, and optimization.
- Acting, learning, and reasoning to plan, act, and monitor behavior.
- Social AI, learning, and reasoning for multi-agent interactions and human AI collaboration.
- Auto AI to automate the development and deployment of AI systems, and democratize the access to state-of-the-art technologies.

<a href="https://tailor-network.eu" terget=_blank>TAILOR</a> is an EU-funded ICT-48 Network (GA 952215) with the purpose of building the capacity of providing the scientific foundations for Trustworthy AI in Europe by developing a network of research excellence centres leveraging and combining learning, optimization and reasoning.

- TAILOR is a network of research excellence centres across all of Europe on the Foundations of Trustworthy AI based on four powerful instruments (a strategic roadmap committee, basic research program to address grand challenges, a connectivity fund for active dissemination to the larger AI community, and network collaboration activities promoting research exchanges, training materials and events, and joint PhD supervision.
- TAILOR is developing an ambitious research and innovation roadmap for the foundation of Trustworthy AI leveraging Europeâ€™s strengths and opportunities, across multiple disciplines, maturity levels, and geographical location. Seeds for its implementation are proposed: challenges regarding both the basic research themes and application use-cases; a PhD program favouring immersion of PhDs in industry.
- TAILOR launched and executes five basic research programs validating the operation of the network and performing ground-breaking basic research integrating learning, optimisation and reasoning in key areas for providing the scientific foundations for Trustworthy AI.
- TAILOR is developing and building on new mechanisms to step up AI outreach, harmonize training curricula, and significantly strengthen European capacities in AI research on Trustworthy AI.
- TAILOR brings together leading AI research centres from learning, optimisation and reasoning together with major European companies representing important industry sectors into a single scientific network to reduce the fragmentation, boost the collaboration, and increase the AI research capacity of Europe as well as attracting and retaining talents in Europe.

TAILOR, like all the research projects, is based on Work Pakages (WPs).
WP3 (Trustworthy AI) aims at advancing knowledge on the six dimensions and putting each of them in relationships with foundation themes.
