# Re-identification Attack

*Synonyms*: Linking attack, Attack on pseudonymised data

## In Brief
**Re-identification attack** aims to link a certain set of data related to an individual in a dataset (which does not contain direct identifiers) to a real identity, relying on additional information.

## More in Detail

A first, basic, and simple way to preserve a subject's privacy is to
de-couple the identity of said subject from its data. This is process is
called {doc}`./L2.pseudonymization`. The typical practical approach to achieve
pseudonymity is to detect which attributes in the data may reveal the
subject's identity, called *personal identifiers*, and substitute them
with some other value. While this process can help in reducing the risk of a direct
re-identification of the data subjects based on the published data, re-identification can still be possible in certain cases. 

Indeed, additional information (usually called *background information*) can be used by a malicious third party (often called *adversary* or *attacker*) to link a subject's identity to its data.
Additional information makes the difference between *pseudonymised* and
*anonymised* data. Anonymous data are deprived of all distinctive
elements of the person, i.e., those elements that permit to identify
both directly or indirectly that person in the data. Anonymous data
cannot be re-identified by definition, even when using additional
information, therefore this type of data is not subject to the current privacy
regulations (e.g., the GDPR {cite}`gdpr`).

This key difference can be better understood with the famous real life
example of the attack on the privacy of the Governor of Massachussetts.
In 1996, *William Floyd Weld*, then Governor of Massachusetts, lost his
consciousness during a public event. Rushed to the nearby Deaconess
Waltham Hospital, he was officially diagnosed with influenza and
consequently discharged the following day {cite}`BarthJones2012`. Some time
later, professor Latanya Sweeney, a graduate computer science student at
MIT at the time, successfully reconstructed what had happened to the
governor and inferred his diagnosis linking two different data sources:
a publicly available voter rolls dataset and a hospital dataset without patients' names, thus
considered anonymous {cite}`SweeneyGov`. The voter rolls dataset contained
the name, address, ZIP code, birth date, sex and other attributes of
every voter in the city of Cambridge (Middlesex County). The hospital
dataset was issued to researchers by the Massachusetts Group Insurance
Commission and contained diagnosis of patients along with some demographic 
information. Since the identity of the different patients was not
present in the hospital data, the information published there
was considered harmless; indeed, this is almost true if thery are considered by themselves. But Sweeney knew that the governor was
admitted to the hospital, so she also knew he was present in the data.
Therefore, she (in a complete legittimate way) gained access to both datasets and she intersected the demographic information in the two
dataset, discoverying some important facts: *six individuals in the hospital dataset shared the Governor's
birth date; only three of these were men; but only one of these men lived
in the Governor's own ZIP code*.

In {numref}`tab_vote` and {numref}`tab_medical` we can see a simplified version of Sweeney's attack. 
Looking at the tables singularly, no *sensitive information* (i.e., the diagnosis) about the Governor William Floyd Weld can be inferred. However, from {numref}`tab_vote` we gain access to the date of birth and ZIP code of Governor. Then, we can search for the persons born on July 31, 1945 in {numref}`tab_medical`, finding patients number 1, 2, 3 and 4. However, ids 3 and 4 correspond to women, so we should consider only individuals 1 and 2. Finally, we can look at the ZIP code in {numref}`tab_medical`: the patient number 1 lives in a different area, so we only have one patient (the number 2) that can be the Governor. In brief, we can see that, matching the information colored in <span style='background:#00bfec'>blue</span> from the two tables, there is no other possibility for Governor Weld but to be a patient suffering from a stroke. This was a clear breach of the privacy of the Governor, as the public statement about his health differed from the actual cause of hospitalization.

Sweeney conducted similar attacks in a more structured and generalised experiment, finding that 87% of the United States population was uniquely or nearly uniquely identified by the combination of ZIP code, gender, and date of birth {cite}`kanon`. This leaded Sweeney to theorize the k-anonymity principle, and call the attributes used for the re-identification process *quasi-identifier*.
