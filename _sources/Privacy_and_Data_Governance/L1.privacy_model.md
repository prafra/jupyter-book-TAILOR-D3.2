# Privacy Models

There are essentially two families of models, based on different goals and mechanisms: [anonymity by randomization](./L2.randomization.md) (where the most recent paradigm is {doc}`./L2.differential_privacy`) and [anonymity by indistinguishability](./L2.indistinguishability.md) (whose most famous example is {doc}`./L2.k_anonymity`).
