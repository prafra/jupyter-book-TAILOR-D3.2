# Reliability

*Synonyms*: Dependability.

The objective of **reliability** is that an AI system behaves exactly as its designers intended and anticipated, over time. A reliable system adheres to the specifications it was programmed to carry out at any time. Reliability is therefore a measure of consistency of operation and can establish confidence in the safety of a system based upon the dependability with which it operationally conforms to its intended functionality.
