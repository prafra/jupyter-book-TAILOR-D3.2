# Data Poisoning

**Data poisoning** occurs when an adversary modifies or manipulates part of the dataset upon which a model will be trained, validated, or tested. By altering a selected subset of training inputs, a poisoning attack can induce a trained AI system into curated misclassification, systemic malfunction, and poor performance. An especially concerning dimension of targeted data poisoning is that an adversary may introduce a ‘backdoor’ into the infected model whereby the trained system functions normally until it processes maliciously selected inputs that trigger error or failure. Data poisoning is possible because data collection and procurement often involves potentially unreliable or questionable sources. When data originates in uncontrollable environments like the internet, social media, or the Internet of Things, many opportunities present themselves to ill-intentioned attackers, who aim to manipulate training examples. Likewise, in third-party data curation processes (such as ‘crowdsourced’ labelling, annotation, and content identification), attackers may simply handcraft malicious inputs.
