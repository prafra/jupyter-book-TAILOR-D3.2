# Security

The goal of **security** encompasses the protection of several operational dimensions of an AI system when confronted with possible attacks, trying to take control of the system or having access to design, operational or personal information. A secure system is capable of maintaining the integrity of the information that constitutes it. This includes protecting its architecture from the unauthorised modification or damage of any of its component parts. A secure system also keeps confidential and private information protected even under hostile or adversarial conditions.
