# Justice

**Justice** encompasses three different perspectives: (1) *fairness* understood as the fair treatment of people, (2) *rightness* as the quality of being fair or reasonable, and (3) a legal system, the scheme or system of law. Justice can be distinguished between *substantive* and *procedural*.
