# Data Center 
<!-- (Sustainability) -->

A **data centre** is a structure, a specialised area inside a structure, or a collection of structures used to house computer systems and related components such as telecommunications and storage systems. Because IT operations are so important for business continuity, they usually incorporate redundant or backup components and infrastructure for power, data transmission connections, environmental control (such as air conditioning and fire suppression), and other security systems. A huge data centre is a large-scale activity that consumes the same amount of power as a small town.
