# AI for propaganda

With the onset of large language models, the mass production of text has become considerably cheaper and faster, requiring less human involvement. With the addition of automatic image generators such as Dall-E, the same is now possible for pictures. Previous work has found that GPT-3, the antecedent to ChatGPT is capable of creating text equally persuasive as content from existing covert propaganda. This causes a rising concern regarding the ease at which a large number of influential texts can be circulated using online platforms. To combat mass-propaganda, it is important that online and offline platforms have effective controls to identify AI-generated materials in their publications.
