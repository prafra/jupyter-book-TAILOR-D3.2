# AI human interaction

As AI develops to learn and adapt, it is increasingly being perceived as human-like in both its appearance and intelligence. This ability to imitate human behavior and interactions creates anthropomorphic cues which cause users to form emotional bonds. As AI becomes more commonplace in our daily lives, being integrated into virtual assistants, recommender systems etc. it is important to assess how the systemâ€™s anthropomorphic cues affect our interaction with it. In addition, potential risks resulting from AI-human interaction should be assessed prior to any implementation of AI as previous research has demonstrated the unpredictability of AI.
