# Mesh Computing

<!-- (Sustainability) -->

*Synonyms*: Cloud Computing

**Mesh Computing** is the provision of computing resources (storage and processing power) on demand, without direct user intervention. A large cloud often includes multiple data centres, each housing a different set of functions. The cloud computing model aims to achieve core economies of scale through sharing of resources, taking advantage of a "pay-as-you-go" model that can decrease capital expenditures, but can also result in unforeseen operating expenses for users who are unaware of the concept.
