# Attacks on Anonymization Schema

There are a variety of attacks that involve data privacy. Some of them are very context-specific (for example, there exists attacks on partition-based algorithms, such as deFinetti Attack or Minimality Attack), while other are more general. For example, we can have the *Re-identification Attack*, where the aim is to link a identity in the data with a real identity; *Membership Attack*, where the goal is to understand whether or not a particular individual is present in the considered dataset; *Reconstruction Attack*, where one wants to reconstruct (even partially) a private dataset from public aggregate information.
