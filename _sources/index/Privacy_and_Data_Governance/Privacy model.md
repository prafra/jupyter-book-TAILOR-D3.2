# Privacy models

There are essentially two families of models, based on different goals and mechanisms: *anonymity by randomization* (where the most recent paradigm is *Differential Privacy*) and *anonymity by indistinguishability* (whose most famous example is *k-anonymity*).

You can find futher information about Privacy models [here](../../T3.5/L1.privacy_model.md)
