# Cradle-to-cradle Design (Sustainability)

*Cradle-to-cradle Design* (also known as *2CC2*, *C2C*, *cradle 2 cradle*, or *regenerative design*) is a biomimetic approach to product and system design that mimics natural processes, in which materials are considered as nutrients flowing in healthy, safe metabolisms.
