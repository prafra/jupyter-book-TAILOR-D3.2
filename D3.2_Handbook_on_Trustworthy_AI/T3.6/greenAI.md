## In Brief

The goal of **Green AI** is to minimise the negative aspects of IT operations on the environment. To do so, computers and IT products can be designed, manufactured and disposed of in an environmentally-friendly manner.

## More in Detail

The concept of Green computing practises came into prominence in 1992, when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) launched the Energy Star program. The goals of green computing includes the maximisation of energy efficiency, the reduction of energy consumption. 
There are four aspects that are addressed by green IT:
* *Green use*: use of computers in an eco-friend;y and energy-efficient way by minimising their electricity usage and using their peripheral devices.
* *Green disposal*: disposing of obsolete electronic equipment in an environmentally safe manner by repurposing it or recycling it.
* *Green design*: computers and other devices designed with reduced energy consumption.
* *Green manufacturing*: making computers and other systems with as little waste as possible in order to reduce their environmental impact.

Government regulatory agencies are also actively working to promote green computing principles by enacting a number of voluntary initiatives and rules. The following strategies can be used by average computer users to make their computing more environmentally friendly:
* When you are gone from your computer for a lengthy amount of time, use hibernation or sleep mode.
* Instead of desktop PCs, get energy-efficient laptop computers.
* Make sufficient measures for the safe disposal of electronic trash.
* At the end of the day, turn off computers.
* Rather than buying new printer cartridges, refill them.
* Instead of buying a new computer, consider renovating one that already exists.
* Activate the power management options to keep an eye on your energy usage.
