# AI for social scoring

Social Scoring is the concept that all daily actions taken by individuals are monitored and scored for their benefit to society as a whole. Based on this scoring system, you are assigned a given value which determines your access to education, healthcare and other public goods. AI lends itself to social scoring as it excels at facial recognition and movement identification. However this poses several technical and ethical problems. The obvious ethical issue is that the goodness of actions is subjective and the ability of individuals to access goods and services necessary for survival should not depend on their perceived ability to contribute to society. Furthermore, the technical issue with social scoring is that the quality of AI evaluation of movement hinges on the quality of its training data, with biased training data leading to biased evaluation by the AI. Social scoring has currently only been proposed by the Chinese government but other countries including the United Kingdom are using automatic facial recognition in surveillance tapes to search for fugitives.
