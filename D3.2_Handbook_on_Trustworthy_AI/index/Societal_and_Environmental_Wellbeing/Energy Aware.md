# Energy-aware Computing


<!-- (Sustainability) -->

*Synonyms*: Power-aware computing, Energy-efficient computing.


**Energy-aware computing** is part of the Green IT. Power-aware design strategies strive to maximise performance in high-performance systems within power dissipation and power consumption constraints. Reduced power utilisation on a node is one way to reduce the amount of energy required to compute. Lowering the frequency at which the CPU works on one approach to do this. Reduced clock speed, on the other hand, increases the time to solution, posing a potential compromise.
