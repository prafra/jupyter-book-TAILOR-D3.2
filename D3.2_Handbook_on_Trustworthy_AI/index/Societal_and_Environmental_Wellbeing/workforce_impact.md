# AI Impact on the Workforce

The impact of Artificial Intelligence on the workforce can be considered from several perspectives. The most common consideration is the loss of jobs or possibility of deskilling of the workforce due to the introduction of AI systems. A second consideration is the increased demand for workers with a computer-science skill set in order to operate and maintain implemented AI systems. A final consideration is the effect of AI-triggered changes for stakeholders. Prior to the introduction of an AI system, risks and consequences in these areas should be assessed and steps to counter negative outcomes should be considered.
