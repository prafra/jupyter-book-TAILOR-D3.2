# Edge Computing 

<!-- (Sustainability) -->

*Synonyms*: Fog Computing.


**Edge Computing** is a distributed computing paradigm in which processing and data storage are brought closer to the data sources. This should increase response times while also conserving bandwidth. Rather than referring to a single technology, the phrase refers to an architecture.
