# Fair Machine Learning

**Fair Machine Learning** models take into account the issues of bias and fairness. Approaches can be categorized as pre-processig, which transform the input data, as in-processing, which modify the learning algorithm, and post-processing, which alter modelsâ€™ internals or their decisions.
