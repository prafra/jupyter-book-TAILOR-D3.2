# Brittleness

*Synonyms*: Robustness.

**Brittleness** is the degree in which an AI system functions reliably and accurately under harsh conditions. These conditions may include adversarial intervention, implementer error, or skewed goal-execution by an automated learner (in reinforcement learning applications). The measure of robustness is therefore the strength of a systemâ€™s integrity and the soundness of its operation in response to difficult conditions, adversarial attacks, perturbations, data poisoning, and undesirable reinforcement learning behaviour.
