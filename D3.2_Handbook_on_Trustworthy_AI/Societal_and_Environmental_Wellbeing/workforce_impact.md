# AI Impact on the Workforce

## In Brief
The impact of Artificial Intelligence on the workforce can be considered from several perspectives. The most common consideration is the loss of jobs or possibility of deskilling of the workforce due to the introduction of AI systems. A second consideration is the increased demand for workers with a computer-science skill set in order to operate and maintain implemented AI systems. A final consideration is the effect of AI-triggered changes for stakeholders. Prior to the introduction of an AI system, risks and consequences in these areas should be assessed and steps to counter negative outcomes should be considered. 

## More in Details
Similar to previous ages of rapid development, such as the industrial revolution, the AI revolution is expected to have large and unforeseeable impacts on the structure of the workforce. While some changes, such as an increase of demand for workers with a computer-science skill set are currently expected, many alterations to the workforce remain unknown. The remainder of this text will first discuss the expected changes of the AI revolution based on previous revolutions’ trends. It will then elaborate on the considerations developers should make during AI development. Finally, the relevant EU guidelines will briefly be discussed. 

### The AI revolution and past trends
With the growing capabilities of AI, concerns about rising unemployment due to AI replacing workers are growing. In previous industrial revolutions, the medium-skilled industry (e.g. factory workers) generally suffered most as their tasks were repetitive and easily automated. However with the advent of AI this is likely to change as systems may replace both low-skilled workers and high-skilled workers (e.g., journalists). However, following the trends of past industrial revolutions, it has been observed that the number of jobs created based on the new technology tends to exceed the number of jobs lost, albeit with a significant time lag between job loss and job creation {cite}`petropoulos2018impact`. In the case of the AI revolution, experts are expecting a rise in demand for workers with a computer-science skill set to supervise and maintain novel AI systems. As such, a reasonable expectation would be an initial series of lay-offs in both low-skilled and high-skilled jobs, followed by re-education programs to allow workers to supervise and maintain the systems. 

### Considerations for AI developers
With this brief background in mind, developers should consider the impact of any proposed AI system on the workforce. Specifically, the impact on all economic stakeholders should be considered including workers who may lose their job, increased demand for workers capable of maintaining the proposed system, potential re-skilling programs as well as the stakeholders of the target industry. If negative outcomes are identified during this assessment, potential ramifications should be presented alongside the system in order to protect the workforce. 

### EU Guidelines
Systems which may affect the labor market could operate at all levels of the risk-assessment scale proposed by the European Union. As such, developers should gauge the risk of their developed system and implement the associated safety precautions accordingly. However, it is recommended that alongside the legally required precautions, developers also consider the impact of the developed system on the job market. While a given development may not pose a direct risk to user’s health, the system’s impact on the job market may have adverse consequences, which should be considered prior to implementation. If the system is found to pose a high risk of job loss and consequential security to society, developers should present potential counteracting mechanisms alongside the system.
